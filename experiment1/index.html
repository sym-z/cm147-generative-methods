				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to create a satirical and possibly useful retro-style game name generator that takes naming tropes for the 1990s and early 2000's and pieces them together to create retro style game names.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I started with Professor Modes' structure that they used in their quest generator and broke down the title structure into the sections, preamble, starter, middle, connector, descriptor, ending and postfix. I used those fillers and built a sentence that uses the game title with a framing as if a person is telling their friend about a new title that just came out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was the sole contributor to this code, and I found it incredibly fun to piece together different patterns that were used to name games on some of my favorite consoles that I played on growing up. I am really excited to show this off to my friends and family.</p>
