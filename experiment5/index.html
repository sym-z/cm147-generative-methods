				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project is an iterative generator that uses Rorschach tests as references and attempts to build an accurate representation of the tests over time.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>We placed ellipses of either white fill color with black stroke color or black fill color with no stroke color on the left side of the canvas and alter their size and rotation, and then mirror that onto the right side of the canvas.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>Jack Sims</h3>
				<p>I felt like Lyle and I were able to work simultaneously a lot and it helped make the project come together really quickly into a form that both of us were really proud of. I found it was really easy to suggest new ideas and get into a smooth workflow together that made for a really enriching experience all around. Lyle did an excellent job with digging into the nitty gritty of how we were going to approach the overall generation, and I was able to help bugfix and suggest and program ways of tuning the implementation because we used Glitch to code simultaneously.</p>
				<h3>Lyle Watkins</h3>
				<p>I felt that Jack and I were able to contribute equally, and that Glitch made this a lot easier than it otherwise would have been. We were able to watch each other’s changes in real-time and rapidly iterate on our generator without needing to worry about version control. My idea to switch to Rorschach ink blots and mirror the canvas was a big turning point, but that would never have come up if Jack hadn’t mentioned Rorschach tests earlier in our process.</p>
