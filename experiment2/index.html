				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this experiment I really wanted to replicate a photo that I had taken and let the randomization not take too much away from the original composition. I wanted to make something that was fun to play with and had a "Wow!" factor. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Color: I derived the color by using an online color picker to sample RGB values from the scene and boosted certain values in those to make the different parts of the landscape contrast more than others. I made sure that the noise functions I used for the water and the sky could both represent the tide foam and clouds respectively. <br> <br>
				   Primitives: I used rects to handle the tiling of the noise for the sun, sky, water, and shade, as well as the shapes of the flowers and stars. I used triangles to help color in the section of grass in the foreground as well. I used arcs to represent the rocks and adjusted their start and end angles in sync in order to replicate a rising and falling tide. <br> <br>
				   Polygons: I used the beginShape and endShape functions to generate the lines that border the foreground, midground and background, and used them to generate the geologic strata that is inside the midground as well. In the case of the foreground, midground and background, I close the shape when I am done adding vertices, in the case of the strata, I began drawing the shape by using the QUAD_STRIP constant as a parameter in the beginShape function, to have rectangles be represented as sublayers in the strata that are blurred together by adding thick outlines. <br><br>
				   Generativity: The composition randomly generates a lot of its composition. The lines of the foreground, midground and background, the placement of the rocks (and the amount if the user is not in low res mode), the placement of the stars at night, the placement of the flowers and what color they choose to be and the starting angle of the sun are all randomized at the start and when the left click is pressed. The foreground midground and background all use separate noise seeds so they do not mimic eachother's generation. The random seeds used start with fixed values and then are modified by the milliseconds the program has been run once left click has been pressed. <br><br>
				   Life: The sun ray moves back and forth using a sin function that takes an input of the milliseconds that the program has been running for. Similarly, the start and end points of the rocks that are drawn using arcs are adjusted using a sin function with the input of the milliseconds as a parameter, to represent the rising and falling of the tides. In both cases I divide the result in order for the speed to be decreased. The stars in night mode are also interactive, their size can be increased or decreased depending on the users mouse position on the X-axis. The differences between day and night add a lot of life to the scene, at night the clouds are less visible, and there is no reflection from the sunlight on the ocean foam so it is not visible at night either. Also, at night the tides are slower. <br><br>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I had a great time with this experiment and it was really fun getting the night mode in as well! I am really proud of the little details that make up this scene and the life that it shows. Unfortunately when tested on my older laptop, I noticed some frame droppage, so I had to make a low res mode to make my scene more compatible. It seems to work pretty well and I am hoping it is not too slow still on some systems!</p>
