				<h2>Artist's Statment</h2>
				<p>Infinity<br>
					I used the infinite extent of my world to represent an endless burger that has infinite slices of different toppings. Yum!<br>
					<br>
					Variation in Space<br>
					As the audience browses my world, they'll see different orders of ingredients with different patterns and textures, different arrangements of details on the ingredients.<br>
					<br>
					Variations in Key<br>
					Different worlds will have different orders of ingredients, patterns on the surfaces of patties, lettuce, cheese, the sesame seeds on the top bun, the placements of the onions and tomatoes, and the way the lettuce is crinkled.<br>
					<br>
					Signs of Life<br>
					Clicking tiles causes the user to take a bite of the burger, which plays a sound and increases the counter at the bottom, while the passage of time results in a smooth movement of each of the ingredients floating in space. <br>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The idea for this project came to me in class when Professor Modes was asking for ideas from the class of ways to think outside of the box on how to make an infinite generator. I thought of slices layered on top of one another and thought to myself, wow, it would be really funny to make an infinite burger!</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Isolating the tiles that I wanted to draw was a bit of a challenge, as well as finding a way to make sure that each ingredient could be tied to a part of the world key. I carefully isolated the pieces I wanted from the map by using modulus and checking the outcome in glitch's preview window. I used an array of functions that are randomly chosen based on the world key to choose the order of the ingredients and used the world key extensively in how the detail was applied to the slices. I used P5's sound library and a copyright free eating sound from freesound.org for the bite noise that plays when the user clicks.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was not on a team for this project, however it was really fun continuously adding to this generator, and I could definitely spend another week on it if I had to! It was a bit difficult to isolate the tiles for each of the ingredients, but once I found the right values, I was able to build code that was easy to build on top of and add more ingredients to.</p>
